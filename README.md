# Application switcher

Electron application created to allow easy switching between contexts for different work environments. There are/were working extensions for firefox but it seems they are no longer available.

This repository is supposed to fix the issue.

## Installation

It's a node application, pretty straightforward:

1. npm run install
2. npm run dev

And you're done!

If you'd like to build it, try different configurations of forge, I haven't had time to do so myself. I've built this project in ~2 days.

Current features:

* working integration with microsoft teams, google meet

Current goals:

* more configuration

* icons that represent the applications (not this autogenerated crap)

* application templates for easy env create

* more management for applications

* releases
